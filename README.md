Syllabus
--------

In this module you will be introduced to Rstudio and Github. This module
will cover:

-   What is an IDE and why we use it;
-   How to use a versioning system and its importance;
-   Write a simple example of R code;
-   Submit the answer for evaluation.

### Module 1.1: What is an IDE

[:tv: Module 1.1
Video](https://youtu.be/d1PVR37WR_4 "📺 Module 1.1 Video")

Before talking about the IDE, we have to bear in mind that to build a
program, we need only two things:

-   A text file with the code (you can use the notepad for example)
-   A compiler or an
    [interpreter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_language) (the
    former typically builds a .exe file, the later interprets the code
    in real-time)

So why we need an IDE? An
[IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment)
(Integrated development environment) is a software that has as objective
helping the developer to code faster and without errors. Usually, an IDE
has integrated the following features:

-   A **Text Editor**: with code completion (helps you to write faster);
    syntax highlighting (allows you to see clearly your code) and
    sometimes also auto-formatting (to help you to add spaces or
    new-lines where they should be); real-time diagnostics (that shows
    the errors in your code).
-   A **File Explorer** or even better, a **Project Explorer**: that
    shows the project folder and files that are included in your
    project.
-   **Help Documents**: so you can learn or consult the information
    about the language you are using, libraries, functions, etc.
-   **Versioning Control**: allows you to use a versioning control
    system like [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git#Adoption). We
    will talk more about this later.

In our case, we will use the RStudio IDE, that also has these important
features:

-   A **Console**: that is a place where you can write commands, one by
    one (you usually will prefer to write the commands in the Editor and
    save in a file), and is where you can also see the output, messages
    and errors of your program.
-   An **Environment** tab: where you can inspect all variables and
    dataset you create, or it is loaded on memory.
-   A **History** tab: that records all your previous commands
-   A **Plot** and **Viewer** tabs: where you see graphics and other
    kinds of visual content.

### Module 1.2: How to use a versioning system

Now we will meet the [GIT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git "GIT"), the
most [widely
used](https://ianskerrett.wordpress.com/2014/06/23/eclipse-community-survey-2014-results/)
source-code management tool.

You may not be aware, but you probably already use your own version
control when you write a document and save a “draft,” “second draft,”
“final draft.”

A versioning system is just that. It maintains multiple versions of
files.

When you start coding, you will have several versions of your code. You
may accidentally delete something or write something that makes your
program stop working. That’s where the versioning system comes in handy.

GIT is a distributed versioning system. That means everyone who
collaborates with you has a full copy of the repository, which adds
another safety layer. A non-distributed versioning system keeps the full
copy only in a server, that may break and lose all your work.

You might wonder if I already naturally save copies of my work, why do I
need GIT?

GIT allows you to manage these changes while writing your program and
revert some changes to an older version if you need to. You can inspect
the changes you made between versions, work collaboratively, and know
which lines were changed by other users.

So let’s start with the most straightforward workflow you need to start
using GIT in our classes.

#### Cloning a repository

Cloning a repository means that you are making a full copy from the
remote repository while keeping a link with it for future updates.

You have two options to clone the assignment repository:

1.  Using RStudio installed on your machine

    1.  Click on the **⤓ Code** button that is in the top-right position
        of this page. Select the HTTPS tab, and copy the URL presented
        there.

    2.  In RStudio, select **File ➝ New Project…**

    3.  On **Create Project** dialogue, select **Version Control**, and
        then **GIT**.

    4.  Paste the URL on **Repository URL** field and choose where the
        files will be stored, then click on **Create Project**.

2.  Using RStudio on Binder

    1.  Just click on [![Launch
        binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://patient-cherry-7bc4.franzbischoff.workers.dev)
        that is located on top of this document and a remote session
        will be opened. The first times it may take a while because
        **Binder** needs to set up the environment for you.
        [More…](https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/how-to-reduce-mybinder-org-repository-startup-time/4956 "More about binder")

        > :warning:**ATTENTION:** bookmark the URL of your session, and
        > every time you finish coding, **send your changes back to
        > GIT** because this session may be suspended after a certain
        > period of inactivity.

#### Sending changes back to GIT

Before diving in this subject, let me explain the file states.

The files in your project can be in the following states:

1.  Working Directory: here are the files that are unchanged, modified,
    or not yet added to the project (new files).
2.  Staging Area: here are the files you tell GIT that they are ready to
    be committed (modified files or adding new files, or even deleted
    files)
3.  Local Repository: here are the committed changes, or we can call it
    as the latest snapshot of your project.

So, when you first open your project, there is nothing to do. If you
click on the tab “GIT” on RStudio, nothing will be listed there.

When you modify, delete or add a new file to the *Working Directory*,
the GIT tab will start to show these changes. You can click with the
right mouse button on each item to see what you can do about, like
*ignore* this file (the file will not be committed, this is useful for
authentication files that stores information you don’t want to share but
is needed for development), or *revert* the changes you made.

Now let’s start with the interesting part, submit the changes to the
remote repository.

1.  Click on the “GIT” tab to access the Versioning System.

2.  Select all items you want to commit, and click in one of the
    checkbox from the column “Staged”. You can unstage any item if you
    made a mistake.

    > :warning:**ATTENTION:** at this point you may edit any of these
    > files, and it will appear as “Staged-modified” (with a double :m:
    > on status column. **You have to stage this file again**.

3.  Click on the :ballot\_box\_with\_check: Commit button. A dialogue
    will be opened.

4.  Write a message on the “Commit message” box. All commits must have a
    message. It is important for everyone to know what changes you did
    in this snapshot.

5.  Click on the “Commit” button.

    > :spiral\_notepad:**NOTE:** now your changes have been committed to
    > your **Local** repository, you can still make changes and new
    > commits before sending all to the **Remote** repository.

6.  Click on the button “Push”. Now the system will attempt to connect
    with the remote repository. Fill the username and password with your
    credentials from Github, and then complete the Push.

It’s done. Your code is now saved in your **Remote** repository and can
be “Pulled” by collaborators or yourself to update any **Local**
repository.

### Module 1.3: Write a simple R code

Your first task is straightforward:

1.  Create, in the project folder, a new file named “assignment.R” (with
    upper-case .R)
2.  Write any code that prints in the console the following text:
    “Hello, World!”
3.  Save the file

### Module 1.4: Submit the answer

Now that you have all done, use your knowledge from **Module 1.2** and
submit the answer to your Remote repository. Your answer will be
automatically checked.
